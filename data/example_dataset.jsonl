This plant is sensitive to this issue.\n\n**Immediate actions**:\n1. Targeted flush on Plant#1: 2-2.5L pure water (pH 6.0, EC ~0.4)\n2. Measure runoff after flush to verify EC decrease\n\n**Next steps**:\n1. Next watering at lower EC in (1.3-1.4 max)\n2. Aim for 20-30% runoff to prevent accumulation\n3. Monitor plant closely for 3-5 days\n\n**Day of flower context**: You're at day 10, mid-stretch.
